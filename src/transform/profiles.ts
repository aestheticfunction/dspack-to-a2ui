/**
 * A mapping *profile* is pure data describing how a dspack contract's components
 * correspond to A2UI catalog components. The transform engine (mapping.ts) is
 * source-agnostic and reads only this profile + the dspack document — never any
 * framework code. Retargeting a different design system = writing a new profile.
 *
 * The profile below targets the shadcn/ui dspack contract. Two kinds of components
 * are emitted:
 *   - `components`: derived from dspack component entries.
 *   - `synthesized`: A2UI structural/content primitives (Text, Column) that dspack
 *     does NOT contain. dspack describes a component *library*, not a layout system
 *     (its `layout` block is descriptive: breakpoints/grid/spacing, not renderable
 *     components). A2UI surfaces need primitives to be composable/renderable, so we
 *     synthesize them and record that as a fidelity finding.
 *
 * `casualtyComponents` are dspack components with no faithful A2UI representation;
 * they are documented and warned about, not emitted.
